    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So it seems it's the year of the blogs again. I figured it would be a good exercise to get back into it and share some of the things I experiment with, especially related to programming and surrounding topics.</p><p>A few words about me first for those who don't know who I am. I am a mid-century software engineer, in that soft spot between "experienced" and soon to be considered a fossil I suppose. I currently work for Exoscale, a European Cloud platform. Even though what I mention on this blog might occasionally refer to what I do at work indirectly, these are my words only.</p><p>One subject that has been occupying my mind quite a bit lately is complexity in software design in orgs with multiple dev teams. Don't leave just yet! So expect to see a bit of writing about this topic in the future.</p><p>I swear I won't bore about mono/mini/macro/ repos & the like.</p><p>I have a few other things in my bag such as various clojure related topics and subjects related to what I work on day to day, various types of orchestrators that power a cloud platform such as exoscale.  I might also drop the occasional emacs discovery.</p><p>But for now I am just getting this bloging engine setup, courtesy of <a href='Michiel' title=Borkent>https://blog.michielborkent.nl/</a>, and will iterate from there.</p><p>See you on the next one!</p>]]></content>
